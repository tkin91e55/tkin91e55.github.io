      <h3>Hi, I am here</h3>

          <pre>
          Hello, this is my first try to broadcast.
          It is so good to write in a single page!
          There is only HTML right now, more will be updated
          Maybe, I should think this site to be my path on HTML?!

          This reminds me back then the HTML lesson in secondary school
          with Dreamweaver, and it is still popular and here, thank sky!
          </pre>

        <h3>Maybe something missing...</h3>

          I think there are few features need to be added into this site about self:

          1. Sitemap, but not urgent, as there is no much content yet, don't bother to have
          2. RSS feed, neither urgent, as there is no cue I am updating continually.
          3. robots.txt, for web crawlers, but there is no much to crawl
          4. May some layout for organizing things, yes, I like it and make sense.
            ✓ basic information like dates created, last edited, published. I know here is no hiding
              unpublished function.
          5. Visitor counting, many people like this too. How should it be done? As this is read-only
             page, what was the traditional way? Still need some service?
          6. Basic layout of this page.
          7. What else!? I don't know yet
